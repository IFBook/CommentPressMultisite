Commentpress for Multisite integrates CommentPress in a WordPress Multisite environment.

== Description ==

Commentpress for Multisite integrates CommentPress in a WordPress Multisite environment.

== Installation ==

1) Unzip the .zip file so that the plugin's files are located directly inside `/wp-content/plugins/commentpress-mu`
2) If you are using a version of BuddyPress that is less than 1.6 and you don't already have a custom settings file, move `bp-settings/bp-custom.php` into `/wp-content/plugins`. If you do, then make sure you're enabling BP_USE_WP_ADMIN_BAR, which is the default setting for BuddyPress 1.6+
3) Network activate the plugin
4) You are done!

== Other Notes ==

For compatibility with BuddyPress Group Email Subscription, please make sure that BuddyPress Group Email Subscription is network activated, or else comment and post notifications will not be registered in groupblogs.
